      'Researching under the mentorship of Dr. Khoa Luu as part of the Computer Vision and Image Understanding Lab. Co-authored a physics-informed domain adaptation network (NeurIPS 2025 submission) for aligning synthetic and real 2D material images. Created a synthetic dataset of 600K microscopy images across eight materials and 40 layer types. Improved thickness estimation error by 9.1 nm and detection precision by 30%. Achieved state-of-the-art flake layer classification accuracy of 93.9%.',
